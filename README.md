# Project: The Best Movies According to Rizki

## Description

This project is part of the course **Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course** by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. The course covers a wide range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps.

As part of Section 2: _Introduction to HTML_, I completed the task of recreating a simple webpage design using only HTML. The goal was to apply the fundamental concepts of HTML structure and formatting.

## Project Objective

Recreate the design shown in the provided image using only HTML. The project focuses on:

- Structuring content with semantic HTML tags.
- Using headings, paragraphs, and horizontal lines for layout.
- Properly nesting and organizing HTML elements.

## Features of the Webpage

- A title: "The Best Movies According to Rizki" styled as a heading.
- A subtitle: "My top 3 movies of all-time."
- A horizontal line for separation.
- A list of three movies, each with:
  - A bold title.
  - A short description below the title.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The project was built entirely using HTML to practice basic web development skills.

## How to View the Project

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. The webpage will display the structured list of Rizkiâ€™s top 3 movies.

## Key Learnings

- Understanding the structure of an HTML document (e.g., `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
- Using semantic HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>` , `<h3>` , `<p>`, and `<hr>`.

## Next Steps

After completing this section, I will proceed to the next sections of the course to learn Intermediate HTML.
